### 4. Wallet Initial Balance Editing Fix
- **Issue**: When editing a wallet's initial balance, the current balance wasn't being adjusted accordingly, and users could set values that would result in negative balances
- **Root Cause**: The `EditWallet` page lacked logic to handle initial balance changes and had no validation to prevent negative balance scenarios
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `mutateFormDataBeforeSave()` method to `EditWallet` page
  - Calculates the difference between old and new initial balance
  - **Added validation to prevent negative current balances**
  - Shows clear error messages when invalid values are attempted
  - Calculates and displays minimum allowed initial balance in form hints
  - Adjusts current balance by the difference to maintain transaction history integrity
  - Enhanced form helper text to explain the behavior during editing
  - Added bilingual translations for all new messages and hints
- **UX Improvements**:
  - Form shows minimum allowed initial balance in real-time
  - Clear error notifications explain why certain values are not allowed
  - Prevents users from accidentally creating negative wallet balances
  - Maintains data integrity while providing helpful feedback
- **Result**: Users can now safely edit wallet initial balances with proper validation and clear feedback
